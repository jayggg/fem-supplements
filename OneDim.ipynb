    "In this activity, we become familiar with a computational object that can represent members of the simplest finite element space, called the Lagrange finite element space. These are *vector spaces of functions* on a spatial domain. We will begin by seeing how distinct finite elements on a mesh are glued together to form such a space. The glued function space is often called a *global finite element space* to contrast it with the spaces on each individual finite element, referred to as *local finite element spaces*."
