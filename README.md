# Working with Finite Elements

<br>
<br>

*This is a collection of notebooks prepared for*  **hands-on class
activities on finite elements,**  *combining mathematics and
computations, using the open-source library*
[NGSolve](https://ngsolve.org).

- It is appropriate for use in graduate finite element courses as
supplementary open educational material. 

- It is not intended to replace textbooks.

- It is intended to provide starting points for instructor-guided
open-ended interactive experimentation in class.

- These materials were developed, used, and updated during a 2025-26
  graduate course offering on finite elements at [Portland State
  University](https://www.pdx.edu).

- These materials are part of the training resources developed for the
  RTG cohort supported by NSF grant DMS-2136228.
