# Hands-on Class Activities on Finite Elements


This is a collection of notebooks prepared for hands-on mathematical class
activities using the open-source library
[NGSolve](https://ngsolve.org). 

- It is appropriate for use in graduate finite element courses as
supplementary open educational material. 

- It is not intended to replace textbooks.

- It is intended to provide starting points for instructor-guided
open-ended interactive experimentation in class.

- These materials were last used and updated during a
2025-26 graduate course offering on finite elements at [Portland State
University](https://www.pdx.edu).
